  <p>LG Twins Baseball Club (Korean: LG 트윈스 프로야구단) is a South Korean professional baseball team based in Seoul, South Korea. They are a member of the KBO League and are one of the most popular baseball teams in Korea. They gained many fans in the 1980s–2000s, most of whom live in Seoul. The club was first established as MBC Chungyong owned by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation until 1989, when they were taken over by LG Corporation. The LG Twins play their home games at Jamsil Baseball Stadium, which they share with their rival, the Doosan Bears.[1] Chungyong first used Jamsil Baseball Stadium since 1982—the first year of Korean pro baseball league—and the Bears started using the same stadium three years later, in 1985.</p>
